            <h3><a id="Space" href="./SPACE_INVADE.py">Space Invaders</a></h3>
            <p>
                I used python to create a game similiar to Space Invaders. I really enjoy games so I wanted a project to reflect that. The game uses
                turtle graphics. It incorporates player movement, enemy movement, firing bullets, collision detection, and a score display.

            <h3><a id="CYOA" href="./CYOA.py">Choose Your Own Adventure Game</a></h3>
            <p>
                The Choose your own adventure game that I created uses input statements as well as if, elif, and print statements to ask the player to a question and prompt them a question, and will then give them a response based on the awnser they selected.
            </p>

            <h3><a id="DR" href="./Dice Roller.py"> Dice Roller </a></h3>
            <p>
                I made two functions and a while loop. Within the while loop I used the randint function to get a random number from one to six, and then I printed the results.
            </p>
            <h3><a id="LGC" href="./Letter Grade Converter.py">Letter Grade Converter</a></h3>
            <p>
                I used a while loop and if/elif statements to take a input number and return a corresponding letter grade.
            </p>
            <h3><a id="PCC" href="./Pay Check Calculator.py">Pay Check Calculator</a></h3>
            <p>
                I started off with a while loop, I took two inputs and then I did a couple of math calculations. Next I just printed the results
            </p>
            <h3><a id="PNC" href="./Prime Number Checker.py">Prime Number Checker</a></h3>
            <p>
                I made two functions, to make a list, and then prompt the player to input a number. Next I calculate the factors of that number to figure out if it is a prime number. If it is prime it prints that and if it is not then it prints the factors and then asks if you want to try again.
